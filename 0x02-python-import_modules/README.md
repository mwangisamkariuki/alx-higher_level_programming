# Task 0:Import a simple function from a simple file
**Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b):
from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3
You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b**

# Task 1: My first toolbox!
$$
Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py,
does some Maths, and prints the result.
Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
You have to define:
the value 10 to a variable a
the value 5 to a variable b
and use those two variables only, as arguments when calling functions (including print)
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 10 and another b = 5
Your program should call each of the imported functions. See example below for format
the word calculator_1 should be used only once in your file
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported
