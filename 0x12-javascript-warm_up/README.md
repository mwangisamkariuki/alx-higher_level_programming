# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
    JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:
    Scripting (same as we did with Python)
    Web front-end
# Task 0: 0. First constant, first print  
    A script that prints "Javascript is amazing"
# Task 1:
    Write a script that prints 3 lines:
        The first line: “C is fun”
        The second line: “Python is cool”
        The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
# Task 2: Arguments
    A script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
        If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
        If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
        Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
# Task 3: Value of my argument
    A script that prints the first argument passed to it:
# Task 4: create a sentence
    Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”
    You must use console.log(...) to print all output
    You are not allowed to use var
# Task 5: An Integer
     script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer>
     ....if the first argument can be converted to an integer:
     If the argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Not a number”
# Task 6: Loop to languages
    Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi_languages.js)
    but by using an array of string and a loop
# Task 7:I love C
    Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”
    Where x is the first argument of the script
    f the first argument can’t be converted to an integer,
    print “Missing number of occurrences”
# Task 8: Square
    Write a script that prints a square
        The first argument is the size of the square
        If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size”
        You must use the character X to print the square
# Task 9:Add
    Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
        The first argument is the first integer
        The second argument is the second integer
        You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)
# Task 10: Factorial
    Write a script that computes and prints a factorial
        The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
        Factorial of NaN is 1
        You must do it recursively
        You must use a function
# Task 11: Second Biggest
    Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.
        You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
        If no argument passed, print 0
        If the number of arguments is 1, print 0
# Task 12: Objects
    Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:  
# Task 13: Add file
    Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.
        The function must be visible from outside
        The name of the function must be add
        You are not allowed to use var
# Task 14:Const or not const
    Write a file that modifies the value of myVar to 333
# Task 15:
    Write a function that executes x times a function.
        The function must be visible from outside
        Prototype: function (x, theFunction)
        You are not allowed to use var
# Task 16: add me Maybe
    Write a function that increments and calls a function.
        The function must be visible from outside
        Prototype: function (number, theFunction)
        You are not allowed to use var
# Task 17:
