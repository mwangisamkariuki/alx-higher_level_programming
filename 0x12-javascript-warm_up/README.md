    Scripting (same as we did with Python)
    Web front-end
# Task 0: 0. First constant, first print  
    A script that prints "Javascript is amazing"
# Task 1:
    Write a script that prints 3 lines:
        The first line: “C is fun”
        The second line: “Python is cool”
        The third line: “JavaScript is amazing”
# Task 2: Arguments
    A script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
        If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
        If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
        Otherwise, print “Arguments found”
# Task 3: Value of my argument
    A script that prints the first argument passed to it:
