# Task 0:0. Print a list of integers
    Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
    Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
    Format: one integer per line. See example
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You can assume that the list only contains integers
# Task 1:Secure access to an element in a list
    Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
    Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
    If idx is negative, the function should return None
    If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You are not allowed to use try/except
# Task 2:Replace element
    Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
    Prototype: def replace_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
    If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
    If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You are not allowed to use try/except
# Task 3: Print a list of integers... in reverse!
    Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
    Prototype: def print_reversed_list_integer(my_list=[]):
    Format: one integer per line. See example
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You can assume that the list only contains integers
    You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
    You have to use str.format() to print integers
# Task 4: Replace in a copy
    Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific
    position without modifying the original list (like in C).
    Prototype: def new_in_list(my_list, idx, element):
    If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
    If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list),
    the function should return a copy of the original list
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You are not allowed to use try/except
# Task 5: Can you C me now?
    Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
    Prototype: def no_c(my_string):
    The function should return the new string
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You are not allowed to use str.replace()
# Task 6: Lists of lists = Matrix
    Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
    Prototype: def print_matrix_integer(matrix=[[]]):
    Format: see example
    You are not allowed to import any module
    You can assume that the list only contains integers
    You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
    You have to use str.format() to print integers
