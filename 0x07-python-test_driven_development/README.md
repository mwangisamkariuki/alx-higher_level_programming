# TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
# Task 0: Integers addition
    Write a function that adds 2 integers.

    Prototype: def add_integer(a, b=98):
    a and b must be integers or floats, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message a must be an integer or b must be an integer
    a and b must be first casted to integers if they are float
    Returns an integer: the addition of a and b

# Task  1.Divide a matrix
    Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
    Prototype: def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    matrix must be a list of lists of integers or floats,
    otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
    Each row of the matrix must be of the same size,
    otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message Each row of the matrix must have the same size
    div must be a number (integer or float),
    otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message div must be a number
    div canâ€™t be equal to 0,
    otherwise raise a ZeroDivisionError exception with the message division by zero
    All elements of the matrix should be divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places
    Returns a new matrix
