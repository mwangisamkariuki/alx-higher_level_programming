# Task 0: Squared simple
    Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
    Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
    matrix is a 2 dimensional array
    Returns a new matrix:
    Same size as matrix
    Each value should be the square of the value of the input
    Initial matrix should not be modified
